This project contains a simple example of a 2-point line tool for CorelDRAW (X7 - Update 1 and later) or Corel DESIGNER X7 or later.
If the project is correctly set up and you have write access to the CorelDRAW or Corel DESIGNER install folder, the tool and required 
files will be copied to the install folder when the project is built.  "Start Debugger" will launch CorelDRAW or Corel DESIGNER and 
you will be able to use your tool.  

User created addon tools require you to be signed in as a registered standard or premium user to use the tool.

Holding F8 is required if any changes are made to UserUI.xslt.  While developing your tool, you may want to keep a backup of 
your existing workspace or create a dummy workspace.

Addons are located at "<CorelDRAW/Corel DESIGNER install folder>\Programs\Addons\<your tool name>\"
 ** Location is Programs\ for 32-bit, Programs64\ for 64-bit.  If both 32-bit and 64-bit are installed, the 
    Visual Studio Project template will choose 64-bit.

==========
This file is responsible for defining new controls and non-customizable UI.  New controls, dialogs and dockers are
